        <h1>Solar Eclipse</h1>
        <ol>
        <h2>Explanation:</h2>
        
        <li>Eclipse: Takes place when a large body like a planet or moon moves into the shadow of another large body. There are two types of eclipses, a lunar and a solar eclipse.</p>
    
        <li><b>Three different types of eclipses:</b></p>
    
        <li>A total solar eclipse, which is when the sun is blocked by the moon completely. The people that have the best vision of this are  the people located in the center of the moon's shadow. </p>
        
        <li>A partial solar eclipse, which is when the moon and sun are not 100% lined up. The sun has a dark shaddow on a small part of the surface.</p>
        
        <li>A annular (ANN you ler), which is when the moon is furthest from the earth. It does not  block the whole entire sun, there is an outline of the sun around the moon.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>Solar Eclipses occur every 18 months, they only last for a couple of minutes.</p>
        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        
        <p>Never look at the eclipse without proper safety equipment.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at the eclipse with out proper safety equipment can cause permanent damage to your eyes.</p>
        
        <p>Never look at the eclipse through an unfiltered telescope, camera, glasses, and binoculars.</p>
